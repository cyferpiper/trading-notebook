# Head and Shoulders

## Description

A "Head and Shoulders" pattern is defined by an initial spike (the left
shoulder), followed by a second larger spike (the head), then by a third spike
(the right shoulder) that is smaller than the second (head) spike.

The following chart was taken from the BTC/USD trading pair on Bitfinex,
between 14:40 - 15:50 on 2017-10-15 using 1 minute invervals.

[Variances between shoulder and head heights, impact of P&L]

## Strategy

The "Neckline" on the diagram below is formed from the low points on the inside
of the two shoulders (*a* and *b*).

**Entry:** Dropping price on the right side of the right shoulder signals a
further larger price drop. This pattern could be entered where price drops below
the neckline on the right side of the right shoulder. A safer alternative entry
point is after the price has dropped below the previous low point (*b* on the
diagram). The entry point on the diagram below uses the safer, second option.

**Exit:** [todo]

**Stop:** Set just above the top of the right shoulder. If the price rises
above this point the pattern has been broken and trading behaviour needs to be
reassessed. It was anticipated that buying pressure had been exhaused, but if
the price rises above the top of the right shoulder, this is not the case.
